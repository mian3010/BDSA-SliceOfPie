\section{Introduction}
In this report, we will cover central topics of the Analysis, Design and Software Architecture course (BDSA) as we have applied them to our project during the Fall of 2012.\\
\newline
The report documents our activities ranging from our usage of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) artifacts [REFERENCE OOAD, p. 31] to our usage of the Scrum methodology to manage our agile developement. Moreover, we will discuss several C\# technologies and how we have applied them to make our proof of concept.\\
\newline
We have structured this document as a series of sprints (timeboxed periods of incremental development), each documenting our steps towards release date (the time of the project delivery).\\
\newline
Because of the limited time bounds of our project, we have decided to limit ourselves to three sprints:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item An introductory sprint, in which we focused a lot on major design and architectural decisions as well as programming some high-risk elements on our system
\item A longer, ‘elaboration’ sprint in which we focused on detailed design and analysis of major components as well as connecting important sub-systems 
\item Finally, a release sprint, in which we fine tuned selected components as well as made the adjustments to our documentation to make it a documentation of a product as well as a process.
\end{itemize}
Each sprint includes relevant testing as we’ve decided that testing goes hand in hand with development.\\
