\section{Sprint 1: First iteration}
In this section, we will present and discuss the development that took place in the first iteration of our project. This includes a relevant presentation of the Scrum methodology as we have applied it in the sprint. We will mostly present artifacts created that are relevant to the inception and elaboration phases of the Rational Unified Process.
\subsection{Initial Scrum}
Before initializing our first sprint, we decide to conduct two sprint planning meetings in somewhat extended versions. Since this is our first project in which we use Scrum, we decide that we will ignore the time bounds that are specified in the Scrum guide \cite[p.~9]{scrumguide}. This allow us to discuss and familiarize ourselves with the Scrum concepts.\\
The initial meetings are divided into several parts: First, we agree on using the Scrumwise \cite{scrumwise} tool for organizing our Scrum activities. Then, we all democratically build the product backlog by filling it with backlog items. \\
An important part of the formation of our team before the first sprint were also doing a formal written definition of done. This includes defining a strategy for testing, coding, documentation and acceptance from the rest of the team. The definition of done can be viewed in [Appendix, \ref{defdone} and \ref{deftesting}, page \pageref{defdone} and \pageref{deftesting}].\\

Finally, we agree on the number and length of the sprints we were going to do. This means also creating an overall timeline of the sprints, which can be viewed in [Appendix, Illustrations, Figure \ref{sprinttimeline}, page \pageref{sprinttimeline}] These initial exercises allow us to conduct the two, more formally defined meetings of sprint planning: part one of two, respectively. \\
A partial view of the product backlog can be found in []Appendix, Figur \ref{backlog1}, page \pageref{backlog1}]

\subsubsection{Sprint planning 1 \& 2}
After our initial Scrum agreements, we conducted planning meeting part one for the next sprint. This involved several noteworthy items:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a capacity plan to get an overview of our initial work capacity [Appendix, Figur \ref{capacityplan}, page \pageref{capacityplan}]
%  ref
\item Estimating difficulty and priority of the items on the Product Backlog
\item And elaborating on the meanings of the different backlog items to each other (as part of not having a single product owner).
\end{itemize}
We then move on to the second part of the meeting, where the team were:
\begin{itemize}
\item committing to highest prioritized tasks and estimating their time to complete
\item distributing the work so the workload was fair on each individual
\item initialize the sprint in the Scrumwise tool and review the burndown chart generated
\end{itemize}
An overview of the first Sprint Backlog is available in [Appendix, Figur \ref{sprint1backlog}, page \pageref{sprint1backlog}].\\

It is worth nothing that even though we decide that we should all have influence on the product backlog, the practical management of the backlog is deferred to one person, the “Product Owner”.\\
