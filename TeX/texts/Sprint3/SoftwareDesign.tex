\subsection{Feature completion}
In sprint 3, most of our design consists of testing, fixing bugs and solving logical errors. We will not implement any new features and make any drastic changes to the existing system design. A lot of work also lies in the documentation of the existing code. Both the documentation in the actual classes, as well as the final diagrams of our system. 
\subsubsection{Case: Synchronization}
One core feature that has reached its final form in sprint 3 is the synchronization process. A full sequence diagram describing the synchronization, reaching from the offline GUI to the Server can be found here:
[Appendix, Figur \ref{clientsyncsequencediagram} and \ref{serversyncsequencediagram}, page \pageref{clientsyncsequencediagram} and \pageref{serversyncsequencediagram}]\\
The diagram is autogenerated from Visual Studio.
