\subsubsection{Sprint Planning}
The majority of our time on this project, has passed and we are heading for the final iteration: Release Sprint. In this sprint, we will spend our time catching up on loose ends, polishing our code, but most of all: this - writing the report.\\
This final sprint is only a couple of days long - three to be exact. Though we expect these days to be anything but short, it is still a very short sprint. Even though we always work hard to keep the pressure of the last sprint, we rarely succeed.\\
This sprint runs from Friday the 14th to Sunday the 16th. With hand-in deadline on the 17th, this can be included as well if necessary.\\
The final artifacts will be done in this sprint: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Diagrams are reviewed and organized
\item Report is proofread
\item Product presentation 
\item Printing report and burning CDs
\end{itemize}
