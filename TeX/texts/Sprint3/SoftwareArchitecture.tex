\subsubsection{Architectural Views}
We have selected the architectural views we find relevant in our project and we’ll briefly define them here before going into detail in separate sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Logical View: This view summarizes our package architecture as well a brief description of some major components. In this section, we’ll include a UML package diagram and a discussion of the Model-View-Controller pattern.
\item Process View: This view explains the processes and threads
\item Data View: This view explains our persistent data model. We’ll review how we map objects to our relational database and commonly used queries in the database. In this section, we’ll include a UP Data Model and an UML activity diagram(swimlane diagram) that shows our data flow.
\item Deployment View: This view briefly models our physical deployment of the programs. We’ll show network interaction between our components as well as the physical components that we’ll use at the demo presentation. This view will include a deployment diagram.
\end{itemize}
