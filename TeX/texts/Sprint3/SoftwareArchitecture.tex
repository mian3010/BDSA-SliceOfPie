\subsection{Software Documentation}
When documenting important parts of a newly created system, one can use the Software Architecture Document template (SAD). The template uses several architectural views, which are different ways of explaining the system architecture by showing different diagrams \cite[p.~656]{OOAD}.\\
Additionally, the SAD defines technical memos which illustrate important architectural decisions. And finally, the SAD covers an analysis of architectural factors which can be displayed in an architectural factor table.\\
We have selected the views we find relevant in our project and we will describe them in the following subsections.\\

The technical memo is shown in the [ref] along with the architectural factor table [Appendix, \ref{factortabel}, page \pageref{factortabel}]

\subsubsection{Logical View} 
This view summarizes our package architecture. To best explain the dependencies of the architecture, we have included in the Appendix[ref] a screenshot of a generated Dependency Graph. This graph emulates an UML package diagram but is interactive and has a slightly different notation.\\
\subsubsection{Process View}
This view summarizes important processes and our concurrent programming. This view contains sequence and activity diagrams.\\
The important processes which we have documented are shown with sequence diagrams that are generated by Visual Studio. There are several diagrams
with different callstacks and they are referenced in the [Appendix, \ref{sequencediagrams}, page \pageref{sequencediagrams}]. 
\subsubsection{Deployment View}
The deployment view is best explained with an UML deployment diagram. The diagram shows interaction between major components and how they
will be deployed and executed during the project presentation. The deployment diagram is displayed in the [Appendix, \ref{deploymentdiagram}, page \pageref{deploymentdiagram}].
\subsubsection{Data View}
The data view contains a description of the persistent data model, primarily of the database. The data view consists of a relational data model
and a description of the database. Additionally, the full SQL schema for generating our database is included. The described components are included in the [Appendix, Sql, page \pageref{sql}].
