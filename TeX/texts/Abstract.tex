\section{Abstract}
During the Software Development course covering Analysis, Design and Software Architecture held at ITU, Fall 2012, we have developed a proof-of-concept for a document viewing and sharing system. The concept contains viewing, editing and synchronizing documents and images through a browser-based web client and through an ordinary offline client program. 
The proof of concept uses relevant network and file storage technologies such as the RESTful protocol for accessing and modifying files on a remote server; XML marshalling from objects used throughout the system to persistent .html files contained on clients  file system, and a relational database to containt documents record changes made to them in the system.\\
\newline
The process of building the the proof-of-concept have been a just as important part of the project as the executable code itself.\\
As a result, the report covers not only program documentation but also software analysis, software design and software architecture. \\
These processes are mainly documented with UML artifacts and terminology described by the Rational Unified Process
 \cite[p.~38]{OOAD}.\\
\newline
During our project, we have applied the concepts of Scrum project management and the related terminology. Therefore, our report is built upon the understanding of this methodology and its impact on the project.
