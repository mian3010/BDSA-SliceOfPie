\newpage
During the Software Development course covering Analysis, Design and Software Architecture held at ITU, Fall 2012, we have developed a proof-of-concept for a document viewing and sharing system. The concept contains viewing, editing and synchronizing documents and images through the web and through an ordinary offline client program. The proof of concept uses relevant network and file storage technologies such as the RESTful protocol for accessing and modifying files on a remote server; XML marshalling from objects used throughout the system to persistent .html files contained on both the remote server and the clients disk, and a relational database to record changes made to the documents in the system.
