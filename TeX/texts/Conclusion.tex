\section{Conclusion}
This section concludes our report. The following is a list of the things we have hoped to describe and achieve with our report and the system behind it. We have:
\begin{itemize}
\item described our analysis of the requirements and its implications for the software we have `released'. 
\item discussed several UML diagrams and how we have applied them to achieve a better software design. 
\item presented several patterns that present solutions to common design challenges - and how we have applied them. 
\item described our software from several views of documentation which we find relevant to the project
\item discussed the Scrum methodology and how we have applied it in practice, including our results with the method
\item described and discussed our testing practices and strategies
\end{itemize}
And finally, we've presented a list of bugs and ideas for improvement.\\
The academic result is a much better understanding of how planning ahead can prevent many frustrating hours of debugging code that's not well thought out. And internally, how effectively managing tasks can prevent ineffective time waste on waiting on others, implementing similar solutions without communicating etc. The project also learned us the value of having a standard notation to improve communication and understanding between team members when dealing with complex logic.\\
Following this conclusion is a list of references and an Appendix. The Appendix contains all the resources which we've drawn but does not fit in the report.\\
