Following points where made when discussing our understanding of SCRUM 
and how to use it in our project:

	1. We consider scrum to wrap around our entire project. This means that backlog
	items should include artifacts such as: report writing, documentation tasks etc.
	We have some doubts whether SCRUM would be applied as such in production environment 
	(or if they would only include customer oriented items here).


	2. We have decided to use planning poker as part of our sprint planning items. 

	
	3. We have decided to timebox our sprint planning meetings to 1 hour for each part, for a total of 2 hours.
