Review of sprint planning meetings 1 & 2 @ 22-11 2012.


After discontinuing our scrum and starting on some UML notation on 21-11, we decided to reboot
with some thorough sprint planning meetings today, 22-11. We used a large amount of time compared to
a regular sprint planning meeting, but this was to get familiar with the terminology and the tools 
we've decided to use in our planning.

We decided that from now on, we'll use Scrumwise to help us in our planning.
