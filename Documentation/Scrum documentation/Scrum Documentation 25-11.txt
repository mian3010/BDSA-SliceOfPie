Notes regarding skype meeting 25-11-2012:

We decided that we wouldn't be so formal regarding our daily scrum practice during our skype meeting.
The reason for this is that it's hard to create a visual overview of the daily challenges during a skype meeting.
Instead, we've informally discussed what work we needed to do and then split up into groups to perform some non-intensive 
tasks. 

Still, the start of our meeting were similar to a Scrum daily meeting as we briefly explained how our progress
were developing and what tasks were on for the day.
